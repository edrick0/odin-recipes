            <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is browned and softened, about 10 minutes. Add peppercorns, garlic, and thyme, and cook, stirring often, until fragrant and slightly browned, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in pumpkin puree; cook, stirring occasionally, until puree turns a few shades darker, about 5 minutes. Stir in chicken stock, maple syrup, salt, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Bring to a simmer over medium-low. Simmer, uncovered, and stirring occasionally, until slightly reduced and flavors meld, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer soup to a blender in batches; secure lid on blender and remove center piece to allow steam to escape. Place a clean towel over opening; blend until smooth, about 30 seconds per batch. Return soup to the pot and stir in heavy cream. Cook over medium until heated through, about 4 minutes.</li>
